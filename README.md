# The Supermarket Receipt Refactoring Kata

On this branch, the exercise is to incrementally add changes, running the tests after each one. 
The end state should be the same as the branch 'with_broken_tests', you just get there in small steps.

To apply each incremental change, merge in a 'pick' branch:

    git merge pick1
    git merge pick2
    git merge pick3
    git merge pick4
    git merge pick5
    git merge pick6

Think of each pick branch as a feature branch where someone has developed one feature but didn't remember to update the tests.
